# Incident-Response


## Objective
The purpose of this project is to train myself in cyber incident response practices. The objectives for this training is to become confident in responding to real cyber attacks and identify network vulnerabilities.

### Skills Learned & Steps Used
- A Linux VM was used to perform commands to assist an incident response team with analyzing log files and creating modifications. For example, in this project I used "Tcdump" command to capture data from a network and "Syslog" to collect information from servers and devices within a established network. The tool Wireshark was also used for packet capturing.

- I also experimented with using the command line with root privliges to identify user log attempts. *See Image 2* Identifying login attempts will assist with suspicious login attempts will help in preventing attacks on a network from an unathorized IP address or from a unathorized user. This action will greatly assist in preventing loss of cyber assets such as valuable organizational data.
