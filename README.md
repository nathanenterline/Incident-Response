# Incident-Response


## Objective
The purpose of this project is to train myself in cyber incident response practices. The objectives for this training is to become confident in responding to real cyber attacks and identify network vulnerabilities.

### Skills Learned & Steps Used
- A Linux VM was used to perform commands to assist an incident response team with analyzing log files and creating modifications. For example, in this project I used "Tcdump" command to capture data from a network and "Syslog" to collect information from servers and devices within a established network. The tool Wireshark was also used for packet capturing.
